## Brief introduction

<font size="3">I'm currently a graduate student at Columbia University majoring in [Biostatistics(Pharmaceutical track)](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu). In May 2021, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics and a minor in Statistics from [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My passion for public health made me choose Biostatistics as my future career path. My previous experience working as a research assistant at Penn State allows me to develop advanced working proficiency in R. Now, I have the opportunity to gain more experience in Biostatistics while doing a research project with a professor in my department. 


Here is my resume [link](resume.html).
